        <p>Question: Why are there three different hobbies on this one website?
        </p>
        <p>Answer: Well, I am a broke human being in a large amount of debt. So while I work two jobs,
            the amount of income compared to debt is small. This means for now I can only afford to publish
            one website. I am sorry for any inconvience.
